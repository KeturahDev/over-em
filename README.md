# [React App Template](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keturah-howard-dev/)

By: Keturah Howard _April 24th 2021_

## Description

An app focused around a thought exercise I found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxn3PtjWY_U). Created for the purpose of stopping a reptative thought/story that we play in our minds that makes us feel worse, and letting go of the person in that story.

### Ideal Audiance

- Those who are still in love/ missing their ex.
- Those who are glorifyiing and idealizing their past relationship
- Those who know that they have to move on and are mostly through the greiving process.

[Coming soon- hosting. for now here's my other site Catter

## Behavior List

### MVP

- user can list all negatives of the person they are trying to move on from
- user can list all that they gain from repeating the sarrow story to themselves
- user can list out all the things they want to do and become from this point forward
- user can gain insight into each part of the exercise by clickin on title of each section and clicking on 'how' button newar title
- user can watch video that inspired the app

### Stretch Goals

- user can export their list to save it on their phone or computer
